        <h2>Traits of Visual Learners</h2>
        <p>
          Visual learners understand best when they see information. They may not understand spoken instructions. Visual students like diagrams, flowcharts, and graphs, and they find handouts helpful, where they can write down what they hear or see as it is being described.
          Visual learners notice small details, so they will remember faces instead of names, and they tend to like balance. They are often quiet students who like to read, draw, and do craft. They will watch a situation before getting involved. Visual learners express themselves through creativity.
