        <h2>Traits of Tactile/Kinaesthetic Learners</h2>
        <p>
          Tactile/kinaesthetic learners process information best when they experience the world themselves. For example, when learning how to tie shoelaces, they will learn by trial and error, using practical ways and working it out with their own hands.
          They enjoy being busy and using real tools and materials to imitate their teachers and learn skills. They learn best by moving.
          They are often considered hyperactive because they get bored and fidgety easily. They show excitement and interest by moving around.
          They enjoy exploring and find it easier to understand abstract topics if they are explained in practical examples.
          They often talk fast and use their hands, using touch, space, and movement to learn.
