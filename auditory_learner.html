        <h2>Traits of Auditory Learners</h2>
        <p>
          Auditory learners understand information best when they are given verbal instructions. Only 30% of school students are auditory learners.
          They often memorize best by hearing and speaking out loud. They may talk a lot and interrupt others. They remember names better than faces.
          Noise and music are very distracting, and they donâ€™t benefit as much as other learners from pictures or practical activities.
          When listening, they often look distracted, and like they are listening to their thoughts, with their eyes looking down to the right.
          They often play musical instruments and sing or hum to themselves when busy. They may be slow readers and find it hard to understand graphs and diagrams or read maps.
